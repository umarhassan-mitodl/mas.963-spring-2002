Course Overview
---------------

The nature of human identity - how we think of ourselves, how we perceive others - is a mutable concept, changing with the rise and fall of religious beliefs, social mores, philosophical theories. Today, we live in a world in which science and technology are among the most powerful forces reshaping our culture - and thus our definitions and perceptions of identity. In this seminar, we will examine the impact of science and technology on identity. The topics we will be discussing include:

*   **The nature of identity**: What makes an individual different than all others - how do we classify people? How are technologies changing the ways people define themselves and present themselves to others?
*   **Mediated identity**: How do we sense the identity of others in a mediated environment? How do people use media to create and project their identity? How are communication technologies changing cultural, national, religious and linguistic aspects of identity?
*   **Sensing identity**: How are advances in sensing technologies, biometrics, and genetics changing the way we define and recognize identity?
*   **Privacy**: What are the implications of the increasingly sophisticated technologies for identifying and tracking people? How are the vast amounts of data that are compiled about us gathered, protected, and divulged?
*   **Post-human identity**: Advances in artificial intelligence, robots, and medical augmentation raise questions about what does it mean to be human. Is there a continuum that runs between man and machine?
*   **Portraying identity**: How can new media technologies transform the tradition of the portrait - what are the new ways that some aspect or essence of the individual can be captured and displayed? How have artists responded to the questions above?
