  "course_description": "The nature of human identity - how we think of ourselves, how we perceive others - is a mutable concept, changing with the rise and fall of religious beliefs, social mores, philosophical theories. Today, we live in a world in which science and technology are among the most powerful forces reshaping our culture - and thus our definitions and perceptions of identity. In this seminar, we will examine the impact of science and technology on identity.\n\nThe instructor's course page may be viewed at {{% resource_link \"cc7a6e4d-c461-4e80-8a57-453455a8cd2d\" \"http://smg.media.mit.edu/classes/IdentitySeminar/\" %}}\n",
